<h1>AWS Cloud Practitioner Roadmap</h1>
Amazon Web services offers a entry level certification called the "AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner". 
This repo serves as my personal roadmap and study guide for the exam. Inside, you'll find a variety of resources including notes, practice questions, and study plans that have helped me prepare for the exam. Use this as a tool to aid in your own certification journey or as a reference to supplement your current AWS knowledge.

<h2>Step 1 : The Exam Guide üìÑ</h2>
There is an Exam guide which is available on the official AWS website. A basic understanding of the Exam should be your entry point in your preparation, this document allows you to understand what to expect in your exam. In summary what the document conveys is are the different segments in which the exam is divided into which are:-
<ul>
<li>Cloud Concepts</li>
<li>Security and Compliance</li>
<li>Technology</li>
<li>Billing and Pricing</li>
</ul>

Once you have understood what the topics in brief are its time to start finding resources, which takes us to step 2.
<h2>Step 2 : Resources üìö</h2>
You can find a lot of youtube videos about the cloud practitioner exam, but i wouldnt suggest them personally. Instead what I found very useful was a Udemy course by a brilliant instructor called Stephane Maarek. His videos are clear and precise and he clearly explains all the important and underlying concepts really well. <br>
The link to his Udemy Course is here :point_right: https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/. <br>  
The course also contains a mock test which you can attempt one day before the exam so that you are fully confident. I would suggest that you only take the notes when you feel like it is necessary as most of the content is quiet simple to understand.<br>
Once you are done with the course you can also go through some practise questions which will greatly help you become familiar with all the concepts.


<h2>Step 3 : The Exam!</h2>
The final step in the AWS certification process is taking the exam.The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam is a multiple-choice, multiple-response, and timed exam that is delivered in an online proctored format.
Important things to Keep in mind
<ul>
<li> The exam is 90 minutes long and will include around 65 questions.</li>
<li> To pass the exam, you must achieve a minimum score of 720 out of 1000</li>
<li>Do not try to cheat!</li>
</ul>
<br>
I really hope this has helped you and you are confident now to attempt the exam üòä.<br>
All the best! ‚ù§Ô∏è
